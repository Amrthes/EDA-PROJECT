# Product Data Analysis â€“ Price & Weight Changes ðŸ“…

# Overview

This project performs data analysis on a dataset related to product sizes and prices using Pandas. It covers basic data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical analysis, feature engineering, and SQL simulation in Pandas.

File Name: product_100_rows.csv

Steps Performed
1. Data Loading & Inspection

Loaded the dataset from a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.

Checked for any missing values and duplicates to ensure data quality.

2. Price Analysis

Calculated absolute and percentage changes in price to measure how product pricing evolved.

Identified products with significant price increases and decreases to understand pricing trends.

3. Weight Analysis

Calculated absolute and percentage changes in weight to analyze how the packaging of products evolved.

Identified products with the largest weight drops to uncover potential shrinkflation (products with reduced size without a corresponding price decrease).

4. Shrinkflation Detection

Marked products with a decrease in weight but no price reduction or price increase as potentially experiencing shrinkflation.

5.Category-wise Trends

Grouped products by category
Found average change in price and weight per category
